# You can be lazy and just let bookdown search for the .Rmd files to merge into your thesis.
# For this to work, make sure to start any acknowledgements and/or abstract Rmd files with 
# an underscore, e.g. _abstract.Rmd. 
# Otherwise bookdown will start to merge the abstract in to the body text which almost 
# certainly isn't what you want

# If you specify a sub directory with rmd_subdir, then bookdown will search through this
# folder too
#rmd_subdir: ["extra"]

# Alternatively, you can comment out rmd_subdir and specify manually what files to include with rmd_files
