<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> <strong>Non-Life Insurance Pricing</strong></h1>
<p><!--this will include a mini table of contents--></p>
<p>In this chapter I am going to provide an overview on how non-life insurance works from an actuarial point of view with a specific focus on the retail pricing process.</p>
<div id="chap:non-life-ins" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> What a Non-Life Insurance is</h2>
<p>The Italian Civil Code provides the following definition of insurance contract:</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:ins-contr" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.1  (Insurance Contract, Art. 1882, Italian Civil Code)  </strong></span>The insurance is the contract by which an insurer, in exchange of the payment of a certain premium, obliged himself, within the agreed limits:

</div>
<p>This definition identifies two parties: the <em>Insurer</em> and the <em>Policyholder</em>. The policyholder pays to the Insurer a certain <em>Premium</em> at the beginning of the insurance coverage and the insurer will pay a benefit if a certain event (<em>Claim</em>) occurs. This event could happen zero, one or more than one times, so it is possible to have more than one claim.</p>
<p>Usually, in non-life insurance, the benefit is the payment of a sum. This sum could be predetermined (e.g. in motor theft insurance, where the benefit is usually the value of the insured vehicle) or defined by the entity of the claim (e.g. in motor third party liability insurance, it depends on the damage the policyholder has provided to a third party). Regarding the “agreed limits”, another peculiarity of non-life insurances is that the coverage period is defined as a fixed amount of time, usually corresponding to 1 year.</p>
<p>Starting from this legal definition, we can formalize a non-life insurance contract as follows.</p>
<p>Let’s:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\left]t_1, t_2\right]\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(t_1&lt;t_2\)</span>, be the coverage period;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P&gt;0\)</span> be the premium payed by the policyholder to the insurer;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N\in\mathbb{N}\)</span> be the number of claims occurred during the coverage period (<em>claims count</em>);</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_N\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(t_1&lt;\tau_1&lt; \tau_2 &lt; \dots &lt; \tau_N&lt;t_2\)</span>, be the timing of each claim;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_N &gt; 0\)</span> be the amount of each claim (<em>claims severities</em> or <em>claims sizes</em>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The total cost of claims for the insurance is:
<span class="math display">\[
S = 
\begin{cases}
  0                    &amp; \text{if } N=0 \\
  \sum_{i=1}^{N}{Z_i}  &amp; \text{if } N&gt;0
\end{cases}
\]</span>
For semplicity, in the following we are going to just use the notation <span class="math inline">\(S = \sum_{i=1}^{N}{Z_i}\)</span> with the meaning of <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(N=0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:ins-cashflow">1.1</a> shows the cash flows corresponding to the insurance contract. From this representation we can interpret the entering into an insurance contract by the policyholder as a way to exchange the negative cash flows <span class="math inline">\(-Z_1, -Z_2, \dots, -Z_N\)</span> with one single negative cash flow <span class="math inline">\(-P\)</span>. On the other hand, the insurer undertakes the negative cash flows <span class="math inline">\(-Z_1, -Z_2, \dots, -Z_N\)</span> in exchange for a positive cash flow <span class="math inline">\(+P\)</span>.</p>
<p>The major difference between these cash flows is that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is a certain amount, while <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_N\)</span>, at the time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, are uncertain in the amount, in the count (<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>) and in the timing (<span class="math inline">\(\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_N\)</span>). So, the policyholder, paying a premium <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, is giving his risk to the insurer.</p>
<p>This representation points out the inversion of the production cycle typical of the insurance activity. From the insurer point of view, the revenue emerges at the beginning of the economic activity, in <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span>, while the costs will emerge later. In most of other economic activities, the costs emerge before the selling of the product, so the agent can choose the selling price taking into account how much that product costed him. In insurance activity, the insurer, when is selling his product (the insurance coverage), doesn’t know the amount of costs he is going to pay for that product. Thus, it is crucial to properly estimate the future costs and determine an adequate premium.</p>
<p>From a statistical point of view, we can translate this uncertainty saying that <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_N\)</span> are random variables. Therefore, we can say that <span class="math inline">\(\left\{N, Z_1, Z_2, \dots \right\}\)</span> is a stochastic process. Usually, in non-file insurance pricing, the variables <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_N\)</span> are not taken into account because the coverage span is short and from a financial point of view the timing of the claims occurrences is negligible.</p>
<p>Previously we said that <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_N\)</span> are all <span class="math inline">\(&gt;0\)</span>. This assumption corresponds to the fact that we are excluding the null claims, i.e. the claims that have been opened, but result in no payment due by the insurer. For the values of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(N&lt;i\)</span> we can use the rule that <span class="math inline">\(\{N&lt;i\} \Rightarrow \{Z_i = 0\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(Z_{N+1}=0, \, Z_{N+2}=0, \, \dots\)</span>. Therefore, we can say that:
<span class="math display">\[
\{N&lt;i \} \Longleftrightarrow \{Z_i = 0\}
\]</span></p>

<div id="non-life-insurance-pricing" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Non-Life insurance pricing</h2>
<p>In insurances, the premium that the the insurer offers to the policyholder in exchange for the insurance coverage is not the same for every policyholder. The insurer evaluates the risk related to that policy and determine a “proper” premium taking into account risk related factors and commercial related factors. The process of <em>pricing</em> corresponds in defining the set of rules for determining this “proper” premium <span class="math inline">\(P_i\)</span> for a specific policyholder <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, given the known information on him. In the next sections I am going to better explain what “proper” means.</p>
<div id="compound-distribution-hypotheses" class="section level3" number="1.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.1</span> Compound distribution hypotheses</h3>
<p>The first step for evaluating the stochastic process <span class="math inline">\(\left\{N, Z_1, Z_2, \dots \right\}\)</span> is to introduce some probabilistic hypotheses. The usual hypotheses assumed are the following:</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:comp-dist" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.2  (Compound distribution)  </strong></span>
Let’s assume that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>for each <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;0\)</span>, the variables <span class="math inline">\(Z_1|N=n,\ Z_2|N=n,\ \dots,\ Z_n|N=n\)</span> are stochastically independent and identically distributed;</li>
<li>the probability distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N=n, \ i\le n\)</span> does not depend on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
Under these hypotheses we say that:
<span class="math display">\[
S = \sum_{i=1}^{N}{Z_i}
\]</span>
has a compound distribution.
</div>
<p>The variable <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N=n\)</span> used in this definition can be interpreted as the <em>claim severity for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> claim under the hypothesis that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> claims occurred</em>. The two hypotheses provided in definition <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#def:comp-dist">1.2</a> imply that the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N=n, \ i&lt;n\)</span> does not depend from <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> nor from <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. For this reason, in the following, we are going to use the notation <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to represent a random variable with the <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N=n, \ i&lt;n\)</span> distribution and <span class="math inline">\(F_Z(\cdot)\)</span> for its cumulative distribution function (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(F_Z(z) = P(Z\le z)\)</span>).</p>
<p>Let’s consider the variabile <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N&gt;i\)</span>. We can interpret it as the <em>claim severity for the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> claim under the hypothesis that the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span><sup>th</sup> claim occurred</em>. From the hypotheses provided in definition <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#def:comp-dist">1.2</a> we can obtain that also <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N&gt;i\)</span> has the same distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i|N=n, \ i&lt;n\)</span>. This can be easily obtained as follows:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:z1}
P\left(Z_i \middle| N\ge i \right) &amp; = P\left(Z_i \middle| \bigvee_{n = i}^{+\infty}{(N=n)}\right)
\\ \label{eq:z2} &amp; =
\sum_{n=i}^{+\infty}{ \underbrace{P\left(Z_i\le z \middle| N=n\right)}_{=F_Z(z)} P\left( N = n \middle| N\ge i \right)}
\\ \label{eq:z3} &amp; =
\sum_{n=i}^{+\infty}{ F_Z(z) P\left( N = n \middle| N\ge i \right)}
\\ \label{eq:z4} &amp; =
F_Z(z) \underbrace{\sum_{n=i}^{+\infty}{P\left( N = n \middle| N\ge i \right)}}_{=1}
\\ \nonumber &amp; =
F_Z(z)
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>the step <a href="#eq:z1">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> and the step <a href="#eq:z2">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> are given by the fact that the event <span class="math inline">\(\{N\ge i\}\)</span> can be decomposed as <span class="math inline">\(\{N\ge i\} = \left\{ \bigvee_{n = i}^{+\infty}{(N=n)} \right\}\)</span> and that the events <span class="math inline">\(\{N=n\}, n\in\{i, i+1, i+2, \dots\}\)</span> are two-by-two disjoint, so they constitute a partition of <span class="math inline">\(\{N\ge i\}\)</span>, that allows us to use the disintegrability property of the probability;</li>
<li>the step <a href="#eq:z3">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> is due to the fact that the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(Z_i\le z | N=n\)</span> depends neither on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> nor on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>;</li>
<li>the equivalence <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{n=i}^{+\infty}{P\left( N = n \middle| N\ge i \right)} = 1\)</span> at step <a href="#eq:z4">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> is due to the fact that the events <span class="math inline">\(\{N=n\}, n\in\{i, i+1, i+2, \dots\}\)</span> are a partition of <span class="math inline">\(\{N\ge i\}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> can be considered as the <em>claim severity for a claim under the hypothesis that that claim occurred</em>.</p>
</div>
<div id="chap:tcc-dist" class="section level3" number="1.2.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.2</span> Distribution of the total cost of claims</h3>
<p>Under the hypotheses defined in definition <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#def:comp-dist">1.2</a>, it is possible to obtain the full distribution of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> given the distribution of <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. In this chapter we are going to provide only the formula of the expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>, but, with the same approach one can obtain all the moments.</p>
<p>The expected value of the total cost of claims <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> can be obtained from the expected value of the claims count <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span> and the expected value of the claim severity <span class="math inline">\(E(Z)\)</span> as follows:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\label{eq:s1}
E(S) &amp; = \sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}{P(N=n) \, E\left(S \middle| N = n \right)}
\\ \label{eq:s2} &amp; =
\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}{P(N=n) \, E\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}{Z_i} \middle| N = n \right)}
\\ \label{eq:s3} &amp; =
\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}{P(N=n) \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\underbrace{E\left( Z_i \middle| N = n \right)}_{=E(Z)}}}
\\ \label{eq:s4} &amp; =
\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}{P(N=n) n E(Z)}
\\ \label{eq:s5} &amp; =
E(Z) \underbrace{\sum_{n=0}^{+\infty}{n P(N=n)}}_{=E(N)}
\\ \label{eq:s6} &amp; =
E(N)E(Z)
\end{align}\]</span>

<li>the step <a href="#eq:s3">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> is due to the linearity of the expected value;</li>
<li>the steps <a href="#eq:s4">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> and <a href="#eq:s5">(<strong>??</strong>)</a> are due to the fact that, as assumed by the compound distribution hypotheses, <span class="math inline">\(E\left( Z_i \middle| N = n \right)\)</span> does not depends on <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>;</li>

</ul>
<p>This result tells us that, under the hypotheses of the compound distribution, it is possible to easily obtain <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E(Z)\)</span>.

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.2.3</span> Risk premium and Technical Price</h3>
<p>The expected cost of claims <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> is important because it gives us a first interpretation of what “proper” premium means.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:risk-premium" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.3  (Risk Premium)  </strong></span>Said <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> the total cost of claims of a policyholder, his <em>Risk Premium</em> is given by:
<span class="math display">\[

\]</span>
</div>
<p>The <em>Risk Premium</em> is the premium that on average covers the total cost of claims. As mentioned above, as the coverage spans are usually short, we are not taking into account the timing of the claims so we don’t discount the fact that the claims occur later than the premium payment.</p>
<p>It is clear that this premium, that only covers the cost of claims, is not “proper” in the practice.</p>
<p>First of all, the insurer has to cover also the expenses related to the policy (commission on sales and expenses related to the claim settlement) and the general expenses of the company. Adding the expenses, we obtain the <em>Technical Price</em>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<span id="def:technical-price" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.4  (Technical Price)  </strong></span>Said <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> the total cost of claims of a policyholder and <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> the expenses related to his policy, his <em>Technical Price</em> is given by:

\]</span>
</div>
<p>Secondly, even if the policyholder would pay a premium that on average covers claims and expenses, undertaking that risk with nothing in return would not make sense for the insurer. So, to the Technical Price, some further loadings must be added, as for example risk margin and profit margin.</p>
<p>The result of the Technical Price with these loadings can be further modified based on business logic, as I am going to discuss later.</p>

<p>In this section we are going to better explain how pricing based on policyholder information works.</p>
<div id="chap:pricing-variables" class="section level3" number="1.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.1</span> Pricing variables</h3>
<p>Usually for every policyholder we have a certain amount of information on him that is considered relevant for his risk evaluation. This information must be reliable and observable at the moment of the underwriting of the policy.</p>
<p>In motor insurances, this information could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information on the insured vehicle: make, model, engine power, vehicle mass, age of the vehicle;</li>
<li>General information of the policyholder: age, sex, address (region, city, postcode), ownership of a private box where he parks the car;</li>
<li>Insurance specific information of the policyholder: number of claims caused in the previous years, how long he has been covered, bonus-malus class;</li>
<li>Policy options: amount of the maximum coverage, presence and amount of a deductible, presence of other insurance guarantees, how many drivers will drive the vehicle;</li>
<li>Customer information on the policyholder: how many years he has been a customer of the insurer, how many other policies he owns.</li>
<li>Telematic data: how many kilometers per year the policyholder travelled in the previous years, how many sharp accelerations and decelerations per kilometer the policyholder performed in the previous years.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pieces of information are usually called <em>pricing variables</em>.</p>
<p>We must observe that some of these variables are available for every potential customer (such as his age and address), while others are only available for policyholder that are already customers (such as telematic data that is available only if the policyholder agreed on installing on their car the device that collects this data).</p>
<p>Moreover, even considering the variables that are available for every customer, it is important to be aware on how reliable they are. Some of them comes from official documents (as customer age and address or bonus-malus class), but others could be declared by the customer and his statements are not easily verifiable by the insurer (as the ownership of a private box or how many drivers will drive the vehicle).</p>
<p>This topic of variables reliability fits in the wider framework of fraud detection. Insurance companies put a lot of effort in preventing frauds. This is done with active actions, such as documents checks and inspections, and with predictive fraud detections models. The two most common categories of frauds are underwriting frauds (such as false declaration on insurance related data) and settlement frauds (such as faking an accident). The customer information on the policyholder is usually important to predict both underwriting frauds and settlement frauds. Usually customers that have a longer relationship with the company and own many policies are less likely to commit frauds.</p>
<p>Regarding the topic of variables reliability, the Italian Insurance Associations (<a href="https://www.ania.it/">ANIA</a>) in the last years made some big steps forward by collecting in its databases a lot of information about policyholders and vehicles and making it available to insurance companies. For example, by logging in these databases it is possible, at the moment of the quote request, to retrieve useful insurance specific information such as the number of claims caused by the customer in the previous years or how long he has been covered and useful information on his vehicle such as when it has been registered or how many changes of ownership did it experienced.</p>
<p>One of the roles of the actuary is to understand how reliable the information on the policyholder is and to decide how to use that information.</p>

<div id="chap:pricing-variables-encoding" class="section level3" number="1.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Pricing variables encoding</h3>
<p>Formally the pricing variables can be encoded as a vector of real numbers. <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}_i=(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip})\in\mathcal{X}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^p\)</span>. In the modeling framework they can be also called explanatory variables, covariates, predictors or features.</p>
<p>The pricing variables can be of two types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Quantitative variables</em>: variables, like policyholder age or vehicle mass, that can be easily represented as a number;</li>
<li><em>Qualitative variables</em>: variables, like policyholder sex or vehicle make, that represent a category and are usually represented with strings.</li>
</ol>
<p>The quantitative variables, with eventual transformations, are already suitable to be used.</p>
<p>To facilitate the use of the qualitative variables, they are usually encoded as sets of binary variables.</p>
<p>If a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has only 2 possible modalities, it can be easily encoded in a binary variable <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;\)</span> that assigns <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to one modality and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> to the other. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(x = \text{sex}\)</span>, it can be encoded this way:
<span class="math display">\[
x&#39; = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } \text{sex } = \text{ `Male&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{if } \text{sex } = \text{ `Female&#39;}
\end{cases}
\]</span></p>
<p>In general, if a variable <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span> modalities, it can be encoded in <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> binary variables <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_1, x&#39;_2, \dots, x&#39;_{K-1}\)</span>. For example, if <span class="math inline">\(x = \text{make}\)</span> and it can have 4 possible modalities (‘Fiat’, ‘Alfa-Romeo’, ‘Lancia’, ‘Ferrari’) it can be encoded this way:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
x&#39;_1 &amp; = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } \text{make } = \text{ `Fiat&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\\
x&#39;_2 &amp; = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } \text{make } = \text{ `Alfa-Romeo&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\\
x&#39;_3 &amp; = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{if } \text{make } = \text{ `Lancia&#39;} \\
0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\\
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>The variables <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x&#39;_3\)</span> are called dummy variables. We can observe that all the information about the make is embedded in just these 3 variables, so a fourth dummy variable that indicate the modality ‘Ferrari’ is not needed. Indeed:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{make } = \text{`Ferrari&#39;} \ \Longleftrightarrow \ x&#39;_1=x&#39;_2=x&#39;_3=0
\]</span>
In table <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#tab:dummy-variables">1.1</a> the dummy variable encoding is illustrated.</p>

<p>For some models it is suggested to use also the dummy variable that indicates the <span class="math inline">\(K\)</span><sup>th</sup> modality. This encoding is called one-hot encoding and it is mainly used in Neural Networks. For the models considered in this paper it is preferred the <span class="math inline">\(K-1\)</span> dummy variables encoding, so we will always consider it.</p>
<p>In the following, when I use the notation <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}_i=(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip})\)</span>, I’ll always consider that the qualitative variables have been already encoded as dummy variables, so <span class="math inline">\((x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip})\in \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p\)</span></p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4.1</span> Distribution for the claims count <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span></h4>
<p>The claim count <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is a discrete variable with determination in <span class="math inline">\(\{0, 1, 2, 3,\dots\}\)</span>. Even if in practice the number of claims can’t be arbitrarily high, <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is usually modeled with distributions that give a positive probability to all the numbers in its support. One of the most common distribution used for <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the Poisson distribution.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.2: Poisson distribution for some values of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The Poisson distribution is a parametric distribution that depends on only the parameter <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>. In figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:plot-poisson">1.2</a>, for different levels of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> the distribution is represented. These plots show how for larger values of <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, the distribution is shifted to larger values and it is wider.</p>
<p>Indeed, the first two moments are:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(N)   &amp; = \lambda \\
Var(N) &amp; = \lambda
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>Thus, increasing <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, both <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Var(N)\)</span> increase.</p>
<p>Looking to the distribution shape, we can see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&lt;1\)</span>, the mode is in <span class="math inline">\(n=0\)</span>;</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda=1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p(0)=p(1)=\frac{1}{e}\)</span>;</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&gt;1\)</span>, the mode is in a value greater than <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and, as <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> increases, the distribution assumes a bell shape similar to the Normal distribution one. The convergence to the Normal distribution can be obtained with the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In non-life insurance we usually are in the case with <span class="math inline">\(\lambda&lt;1\)</span>. E.g. the average number of claims for motor third party liability insurances in Italy, in 2018 has been 5.68%<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The property <span class="math inline">\(Var(N) = E(N)\)</span> is an important constraint when the distribution is used in practice. It is possible that the observed data shows a different pattern. Often the observed data shows a situation where <span class="math inline">\(Var(N) &gt; E(N)\)</span>. This phenomenon is called <em>overdispesion</em>.</p>
<p>To address this issue it is possible to use more flexible distributions, such as Negative-Binomial distribution, or to adopt less assumptions on the response variable distribution. One common technique is the assumption of Quasi-Poisson distribution, that we will describe in chapter <a href="chap-models.html#chap:models">2</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="chap:exposure" class="section level4" number="1.3.4.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4.2</span> Exposure</h4>
<p>In section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:non-life-ins">1.1</a> we said that non-life insurances usually have a fixed coverage period that usually spans for one year. Often we work with portfolios of insurances with different coverage periods. For example, this could be due to the presence of insurances born with shorter coverage periods or to the presence of insurances that has been closed earlier. Moreover, in companies data, often insurance data are collected for accounting years. This means that, if an insurance coverage <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> spans in two consecutive years <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(a+1\)</span>, it is collected as two records: the couple <span class="math inline">\((c, a)\)</span> and the couple <span class="math inline">\((c, a+1)\)</span>. This situation is quite common, as usually coverages start during the year and not all at the first of the year.</p>
<p>The coverage span for an insurance coverage is called <em>exposure</em> and it is usually measured in years-at-risk. For instance, if an insurance coverage spans for 3 months, it corresponds to a quarter of year, so the exposure, measured in years-at-risk, is <span class="math inline">\(v=\frac{1}{4}\)</span>. The term year-at-risk comes from the fact that the policyholder exposure is a risk for the insurer, so the exposure is the period in which the insurer is exposed to the risk of paying claims.</p>
<p>It is natural to assume that, if a policyholder has a longer exposure, it is expected for him to experience more claims. Considering that we have to work with policies with different exposures, in order to take this aspect into account, the usual assumption taken in the following. Said <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> the number of claims the policyholder will experience during his period of exposure <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> the number of claims the policyholder would experience during one year, we assume <span class="math inline">\(E(M) = v E(N)\)</span>.</p>
<p>This assumption can be further extended if we assume that the claims come from a <em>Poisson process</em>.</p>

<p>Under these hypotheses we obtain the following result:</p>

<div class="theorem">
<span id="thm:th-process-poisson" class="theorem"><strong>Theorem 1.1  (Poisson Process)  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(\{N(t), t\ge 0 \}\)</span> is a Poisson process with intensity <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, then:
<span class="math display">\[\forall t\ge 0, \forall \Delta t &gt;0, \ \Rightarrow \ N(t + \Delta t) - N(t) \sim Poisson(\lambda \Delta t)\]</span>
</div>
<p>This result tells us that the distribution of the number of events in any interval <span class="math inline">\(]t, t+\Delta t]\)</span> only depends on the size of the interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. Moreover, for the Poisson property we saw in section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:dist-n">1.3.4.1</a>, we get:
<span class="math display">\[E(N(t + \Delta t) - N(t)) = \lambda \Delta t\]</span></p>
<p>So, the expected number of arrivals is proportional to the size of the interval <span class="math inline">\(\Delta t\)</span>. The intensity of the process <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> can be also interpreted as the expected number of claims in a unitary period.</p>
<p>If we assume that the claims that occur to a policy comes from a Poisson process with intensity <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, if we observe that policy for the period <span class="math inline">\(]t, t+v]\)</span>, the claims count in that exposure period <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> are distributed as:
<span class="math display">\[ M\sim Poisson(v \lambda) \]</span>
In particular, if the observed period spans 1 year, we get:
<span class="math display">\[ M = N \sim Poisson(\lambda) \]</span></p>

One of the most common distribution used for <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the Gamma distribution.</p>

Figure 1.3: Gamma distribution for some values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>.
</p>
</div>
<p>The Gamma distribution is a parametric distribution that depends on two parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha &gt; 0\)</span>, called shape parameter</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\rho &gt; 0\)</span>, called scale parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two moments of the Gamma distribution are:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(Z)   &amp; = \frac{\alpha}{\rho} \\
Var(Z) &amp; = \frac{\alpha}{\rho^2}
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>In figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:plot-gamma">1.3</a>, for different levels of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> the distribution is represented. These plots show how changing the values of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span>, the shape changes. We can see that:</p>
<ul>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &lt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_z(\cdot)\)</span> is not defined in <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and it has a vertical asymptote in <span class="math inline">\(z = 0\)</span>. In <span class="math inline">\(]0, +\infty]\)</span> it is monotonically decreasing.</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_z(\cdot)\)</span> starts from <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = \rho\)</span> and then decreases monotonically. In this case, the density function becomes <span class="math inline">\(f_z(z) = \rho e^{-\rho z}\)</span> and the distribution is also called exponential distribution.</li>
<li>if <span class="math inline">\(\alpha &gt; 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_z(\cdot)\)</span> starts from <span class="math inline">\(f(0) = 0\)</span>, increases until the mode and then decreases.</li>
</ul>
<p>In figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:plot-gamma">1.3</a> the first three distributions represented have the same expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(Z)=\frac{\alpha}{\rho} = 4\)</span>, but different shapes. The third and the fourth have the same variance <span class="math inline">\(Var(Z) = \frac{\alpha}{\rho^2} = 8\)</span>, but different expected values. As the shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> increases, the distribution assumes a bell shape similar to the Normal distribution one. The convergence to the Normal distribution can be obtained with the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>.</p>
<p>Another parametrization often used for Gamma distribution is obtained by using the mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> as a parameter:
<span class="math display">\[
\mu = \frac{\alpha}{\rho}
\]</span>
With this parametrization, the density function becomes:
<span class="math display">\[
f_Z(z) = \frac{\left(\frac{\alpha}{\mu}\right)^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)}z^{\alpha-1}e^{-\frac{\alpha}{\mu} z}, \quad \alpha &gt; 0, \ \rho &gt; 0
\]</span></p>
<p>The advantage of using the parameters <span class="math inline">\((\alpha, \mu)\)</span> is that the link between <span class="math inline">\(E(Z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Var(Z)\)</span> becomes clearer:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(Z)   &amp; = \mu \\
Var(Z) &amp; = \frac{1}{\alpha}\mu^2
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>Computing the coefficient of variation we then obtain:
<span class="math display">\[CV(Z) = \frac{\sqrt{Var(Z)}}{E(Z)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha}}\]</span>
This result means that, given the shape parameter <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the coefficient of variation is constant. As we saw for Poisson distribution, it is possible that observed data shows a different pattern. In chapter <a href="chap-models.html#chap:models">2</a>, for Gamma distribution, we will use the parametrization based on <span class="math inline">\((\alpha, \mu)\)</span> instead of the one based on <span class="math inline">\((\alpha, \rho)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Another characteristic of Gamma distribution that could be problematic in modeling claims size is that it has a light tail. This means that, as <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> goes to <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_Z(z)\)</span> aproaches <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> quite fast. This could lead to a poor fitting for <em>large claims</em>. Other distributions with havier tails are for example the <em>log-Normal</em> and the <em>Pareto</em>.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.4.4</span> Large claims</h4>
<p>Modeling large claims in quite difficult in practice because usually there is not a lot of observed data on them, so it is hard to understand if they are related to some risk factors (identifiable by the pricing variables) or they happen just by chance.</p>
<p>First of all, to model large claims, we must define what a large claim is. What is usually done in practice is just choosing a threshold <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}\)</span> and considering large all the claims with a size that exceeds that threshold. The value <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}\)</span> must be chosen sufficiently big to consider large the claims above <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}\)</span>, but not so big that there are not enough observed claims that exceeds <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z}\)</span>. One common choice for Motor Third Party Liability in European markets could be <span class="math inline">\(\bar{z} = 100&#39; 000 \text{\euro}\)</span>.</p>

<p>Given the total number of claims <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>, it can be decomposed as:

\underbrace{Z_{(N^{(a)} + 1)}, Z_{(N^{(a)} + 2)}, \dots Z_{(N^{(a)} + N^{(l)})}}_{\text{Large Claims}}
\]</span></p>
<p>In order to model the large claims it is possible to use the following three decompositions of the total cost of claims <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}

</ol>
<p>If the large claims component weights a lot on the total cost of claims, these approaches could lead to quite different estimations of <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>. In particular, if in the observed data the number of large claims is small, it will be hard to model both <span class="math inline">\(N^{(l)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(P(Z&gt;\bar{z})\)</span>, so the modeling process could lead to a flat or almost flat model for these components. However, with the first approach, a flat model for <span class="math inline">\(N^{(l)}\)</span> leads to distribute the observed total cost of large claims proportionally to all the policies, while with the second and the third, a flat model for <span class="math inline">\(P(Z&gt;\bar{z})\)</span> leads to distribute the observed total cost of large claims proportionally to the expected number of claims <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span>. So, with the first approach, a flat model brings to more solidarity between policies, while, with the second approach, a flat model could bring to an exacerbation of the differences identified by modeling <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the second approach we must also introduce a distribution suitable for modeling <span class="math inline">\(P(Z&gt;\bar{z})\)</span>.</p>

</div>
<p>The binomial distribution is a parametric distribution that depends on the parameters <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> represents the number of trials, while <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> represents the probability for a trial to success. The assumption is that the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> trials are identical, so they have all the same probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> to success. In figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:plot-binomial">1.5</a>, for different levels of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, the distribution is represented.</p>
<p>The first two moments of the binomial distribution are:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(N)   &amp; = np \\
Var(N) &amp; = np(1-p)
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>, the binomial distribution assumes only the values <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (with probability <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> (with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>). In this case it is also called <em>Bernoullian distribution</em> and it can be used to model the indicator of an event <span class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(n&gt;1\)</span>, the binomial distribution assumes a shape centered on its expected value <span class="math inline">\(E(Y)=np\)</span> and fading for values of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> that moves away from <span class="math inline">\(E(Y)\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> increases, the distribution assumes a bell shape similar to the Normal distribution one. The convergence to the Normal distribution can be obtained with the <em>Central Limit Theorem</em>.</p>
<p>From the binomial Distribution it is also possible to define the scaled binomial distribution by dividing its value by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p><span id="def:def-scaled-binomial" class="definition"><strong>Definition 1.13  (Scaled Binomial Distribution)  </strong></span>If <span class="math inline">\(Y\sim Binom(n, p)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Y&#39; = \frac{Y}{n}\)</span>, we will say that <span class="math inline">\(Y&#39;\)</span> has a  and we will indicate it with the notation <span class="math inline">\(Y&#39; \sim Binom(n, p)/n\)</span>.</p>
The support of <span class="math inline">\(Y&#39;\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\{0, \frac{1}{n}, \frac{2}{n}, \dots, 1 \}\)</span> and its probability function is:
<span class="math display">\[
p_{Y&#39;}(y&#39;) = P\left( Y&#39; = y&#39; \right) = \binom{n}{ny&#39;} p^{ny&#39;} (1-p)^{n-ny&#39;}, \quad p \in [0, 1]
\]</span>
</div>
<p>In chapter <a href="chap-models.html#chap:models">2</a> we will use the Scaled Binomial Distribution.</p>
<p>In non-life insurance pricing, the binomial distribution can be used to model the probability for a claim to have specific characteristics. For example we can use it to model the probability that a certain claim is a large one <span class="math inline">\(P(Z&gt;\bar{z})\)</span> in order to model separately attritional claims severity <span class="math inline">\(\{Z|Z\le\bar{z}\}\)</span> and large claims severity <span class="math inline">\(\{Z|Z&gt;\bar{z}\}\)</span>, as we have seen in section section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:large-claims">1.3.4.4</a>.</p>
<p>Another example is the decomposition between claims with only material damages and claims with also bodily injuries. Modeling separately these two components is useful because they usually have a different distribution for the claim size.</p>
<p>As for large claims we can decompose <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> in the following two ways:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
  \nonumber
  E(S) &amp; = E(S^{(things)}) + E(S^{(inj)}) \\
    \label{inj-claim-decomposition-expected-1}
    &amp; = E(N^{(things)}) E(Z|\bar{J}) + E(N^{(inj)}) E(Z|J) \\[12pt]
  \nonumber
  E(S) &amp; = E(N) E(Z) \\
    \nonumber
    &amp; = E(N) \left[P(\bar{J}) E(Z|\bar{J}) + P(J) E(Z|J) \right] \\
    \label{inj-claim-decomposition-expected-2}
    &amp; = E(N) \left[\left( 1 - P(J) \right) E(Z|\bar{J}) + P(J) E(Z|J)\right]
\end{align}\]</span>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N^{(things)}\)</span> is the number of claims with only material damages;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(N^{(inj)}\)</span> is the number of claims with injuries;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is the event that represent that a specific claim presents injuries; such as <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is a representative for <span class="math inline">\(Z_1, Z_2, \dots, Z_N\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(J\)</span> is a representative for <span class="math inline">\(J_1, J_2, \dots, J_N\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Combining this decomposition with what we have seen in large claims decomposition, we can further develop our decomposition taking into account both the presence or absence of injuries and the occurrence or not of a large claim. One example could be:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
E(S) &amp; = E(N) \left[\left( 1 - P(J) \right) E(Z|\bar{J}) + P(J) E(Z|J) \right] \\[4pt]
  &amp; = E(N) \left\{ \right. \\
  &amp; \qquad \left( 1 - P(J) \right) E(Z|\bar{J}) \\
  &amp; \qquad + P(J) \left[ \right. \\
  &amp; \qquad \qquad P(Z \le \bar{z} | J) E\left( Z \mid Z\le \bar{z} \land J \right) \\
  &amp; \qquad \qquad + P(Z &lt; \bar{z} | J) E\left( Z \mid Z &lt; \bar{z} \land J \right) \\
  &amp; \qquad \left. \right] \\
  &amp; \quad \left. \right\}
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>This way, we are decomposing only the claims with injuries between attritional and large. That makes sense because claims that don’t produce injuries usually have small severities.</p>

We will discuss some of the most widespread models for claims count and claims severity in chapter <a href="chap-models.html#chap:models">2</a>.</p>
<p>Defined the model, we have to estimate it using observed data. In general, to model a response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> with the explanatory variables <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}_i=(x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{ip})\in \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p\)</span>, the observed data is in the form:
<span class="math display">\[
\mathcal{D} = \left\{(\boldsymbol{x}_1, w_1, y_1), \ (\boldsymbol{x}_2, w_2, y_2), \ \dots, \ (\boldsymbol{x}_i, w_i, y_i), \ \dots, \ (\boldsymbol{x}_n, w_n, y_n)\right\}
\]</span>
where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of observations in the dataset;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{x}_i\in \mathcal{X} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^p\)</span> is the set of explanatory variable for the observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(w_i\)</span> is the weight for the observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(y_i\in \mathcal{Y}\ \subseteq \mathbb{R}\)</span> is the realization of the response variable <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> for the observation <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>What an observation is, depends on the variable we are modeling. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we are modeling the yearly claim count <span class="math inline">\(N_i\)</span>, each observation could be a policy (or a couple (policy, accounting year)), the weights could be the exposures <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> and the realizations of response variables could be the number of observed claims for that policy (or couple (policy, accounting year)).</li>
<li>If we are modeling the claim severity <span class="math inline">\(Z_j\)</span>, each observation could be a claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the weights could all be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and the realizations of response variables could be the observed cost for the claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. It is also possible to model the claim severity taking into account the total cost of claims for the policy <span class="math inline">\(S_i = \sum_{j=1}^{N_i}{Z_j}\)</span>. In this case, each observation would be a policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the weights would be the number of claims for each policy <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> and the realizations of response variables would be the total observed cost for the claims of the policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
<li>If we are modeling the occurrence of injuries in a claim <span class="math inline">\(I_{Jj}\)</span>, each observation could be a claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, the weights could be all <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and the realizations of response variables could be an indicator that assume the value <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> if the claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> caused injuries and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. As for the claim severity, we can also aggregate data for policy, so each observation would be a policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, the weights would be the number of claims <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> for the policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and the realizations of response variables would be the number of claims that caused injuries among the claims of the policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In each of these cases, <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span> is seen as a realization of the random variable <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span>. With an inferential process we obtain estimations on <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> disctribution based on observations of their realizations <span class="math inline">\(y_i\)</span>.</p>
<div id="settlement-process-and-ibnr" class="section level4" number="1.3.5.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5.1</span> Settlement process and IBNR</h4>
<p>One of the challenges in non-life insurance pricing is that obtaining the observed data is not so straightforward. In many insurance coverages, such as MTPL, the settlement process could last many years, so, if we want to develop models using data from recent years, not all the information is available. To better understand this aspect we have to discuss how the settlement process works.</p>
<p>In figure <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#fig:settlement-process">1.6</a> the settlement process for a claim is represented. At time <span class="math inline">\(t_1\)</span> the insured event (e.g. an accident) occurs. From this moment a liability for the insurer emerges, even if the insurer has not been notified yet. This liability is called <em>Outstanding Loss Liability</em>. In <span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span> the claim in reported and the insurance is notified about the occurrence of the event. From this moment the settlement process starts. This process consists in evaluating the event and understanding the responsibilities of the parts and the entity of the damage. During this process, controversies between the parts can emerge and, in particular if injuries occurred, the damage evaluation can takes a lot of time. When the situation in clear and everything is defined, the claim is settled and the liabilities are payed. In <span class="math inline">\(t_3\)</span> we have the settlement and in <span class="math inline">\(t_4\)</span> the claim is closed. In is possible that <span class="math inline">\(t_4=t_3\)</span>, but in general it is not always the case. If the settlement process takes a long time and the insurer already knows he will have to pay something, he can pay some partial payments during the period <span class="math inline">\([t_2, t_3]\)</span>. These intermediate payments are payed at times <span class="math inline">\(\tau_1, \tau_2, \dots, \tau_n \in [t_2, t_3]\)</span>. It is also possible that a claim is opened and then gets closed without any payment. After the closing (<span class="math inline">\(t_4\)</span>) it is also possible that a claim is reopened and that more payments emerge.</p>

<p class="caption">
Figure 1.6: Claim timeline.
</p>
</div>
<p>From the moment the claim is reported (<span class="math inline">\(t_2\)</span>), the insurer estimates how much he is going to pay for that claim and he allocates that sum in a reserve. As new information emerges and some payments are settled, the reserve is updated. The aim for this reserve is to have a best estimate for the future payments for the claims already emerged. As the claim gets settled, the sum between the payed and the reserved converges to the final cost of the claim.</p>
<p>From this description emerges that:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the period <span class="math inline">\(]t_1, t_2[\)</span> the insurer has an outstanding loss liability for an event that has not been reported yet; in this case we will talk about <em>Incurred But Not Yet Reported</em> claim (<em>IBNyR</em>).</li>
<li>In the period <span class="math inline">\([t_2, t_3[\)</span> the insurer has an outstanding loss liability for an event that has been reported, but has not been totally settled yet, so that liability is just an estimate; in this case we will talk about <em>Incurred But Not Enough Reported</em> claim (<em>IBNeR</em>).</li>
</ul>

<div id="model-fitting-with-available-data" class="section level4" number="1.3.5.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5.2</span> Model fitting with available data</h4>
<p>The IBNyR and IBNeR issue is particularly challenging when we have to perform a risk evaluation at a specific time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. In general <span class="math inline">\(t_1, t_2,\dots\)</span> are not known a priori, so we don’t know if in the future more claims for accidents occurred in the past will be reported and we don’t know if the ones that are already reported will experience a revaluation. That means that, in general, when we model <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> at a specific time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we can’t observe the total number of claims occurred to each policy <span class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> and the payments for each claim <span class="math inline">\(z_j\)</span>. What we can use is:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)} = n_i^{(\text{reported in } t)}\)</span><br />
where:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(\text{reported in } t)}\)</span> is the number of reported claims in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for the policy <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>;</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)} = z_j^{(\text{payed in }t)} + z_j^{(\text{reserved in } t)}\)</span><br />
where:
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(\text{payed in }t)}\)</span> is the amount already payed in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for the claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>;</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(\text{reserved in } t)}\)</span> is the amount reserved in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> for the claim <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>When we use this data for modeling the total cost of claims we must be particularly aware on what we are using. In general:</p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
n_i^{(t)} &amp; \ne n_i \\
z_j^{(t)} &amp; \ne z_j
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>The common case is that <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)} &lt; n_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)} &lt; z_j\)</span>. If we used <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)}\)</span> without any correction, we would underestimate both <span class="math inline">\(E(N)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(E(Z)\)</span>, obtaining a distorted estimate for <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>.</p>
<p>To tackle these problems what is usually done is fitting the models for <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)}\)</span> and then apply a flat corrective coefficients <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}\)</span> based on an aggregated estimate of <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> that takes into account the long settlement process.</p>
<p>An estimate for the expected total cost of claims for a generic policy in the portfolio <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span> can be obtained with techniques based on runoff triangles, such as the <em>Chain Ladder</em>. These techniques are based on projecting the cost of claims already emerged to the final total cost of claims. We are not going to discuss these techniques in this thesis. We just have to know that these techniques provide us with an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>. Let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span>. This estimate does not depend on explanatory variables; it is a sort of average total cost of claims for the policies in the portfolio.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with the available data <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)}\)</span>, the fitting for all the models needed in the decomposition of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is performed and, for each policy <span class="math inline">\(i\in\{1, 2, \dots, n\}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(E(S_i)\)</span> is obtained. Let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;\)</span>. As we used the data available in <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> that comes from claims not totally settled, <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;\)</span> is a distorted estimate for <span class="math inline">\(E(S_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can then balance the estimates <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span> by computing:
<span class="math display">\[
\alpha = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;}} \widehat{E(S)}^{CL}
\]</span>
and applying to the estimates as follows:
<span class="math display">\[
\widehat{E(S_i)} = \alpha \ \widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;
\]</span></p>
<p>We will call <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}\)</span> rebalanced estimates.</p>
<p>The property of these balanced estimates is that on average they point to <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span>:
<!-- ```{=latex} -->
<!-- \begin{align*} -->
<!-- \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}}}{n} & = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha\widehat{E(S_i)}'}}{n} \\ -->
<!-- & = \alpha\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}'}}{n} \\ -->
<!-- & = \frac{\bcancel{n}}{\cancel{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}'}}} \widehat{E(S)}^{CL} \frac{\cancel{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}'}}}{\bcancel{n}} \\ -->
<!-- & = \widehat{E(S)}^{CL} -->
<!-- \end{align*} -->
<!-- ``` --></p>
<span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}}}{n} &amp; = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\alpha\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;}}{n} \\
&amp; = \alpha\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;}}{n} \\
&amp; = \frac{n}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;}} \widehat{E(S)}^{CL} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;}}{n} \\
&amp; = \widehat{E(S)}^{CL}
\end{align*}\]</span>
<p>So, if <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span> is a unbiased estimator for <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>, we obtain:
<span class="math display">\[
E\left( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\widehat{E(S_i)}}}{n} \right)
= E\left( \widehat{E(S)}^{CL} \right)
= E(S)
\]</span></p>
<p>This procedure can be further developed by balancing not directly the total cost of claims <span class="math inline">\(E(S)\)</span>, but its components. For example, we could separately balance the total cost of claims that only caused damage to things and the total cost of claims that caused injuries. This separation in components can lead to a more precise estimate because usually claims that caused injuries have a slower settlement process so they will have a higher corrective coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the dataset contains policies from many years and during last years a relevant change in the portfolio risk mixture happened, it is also possible to compute <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> not with all the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> policies of the dataset, but only with the policies from the last year of the dataset.</p>
<p>The fact that the final estimates <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}\)</span> are rebalanced on <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span> means that the explanatory variables effects estimated with <span class="math inline">\(n_i^{(t)}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(z_j^{(t)}\)</span> are used just as relative effects and not absolute ones. For instance, if the model says that young people have an expected total cost of claims <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;\)</span> that is two times the old people one, that relative coefficient 2 will be kept also in the balanced estimate <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>For this reason, in practice, often the modeling is considered composed in 2 parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Tariff Requirement</em> (or <em>Fabbisogno Tariffario</em>): the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S)}^{CL}\)</span> by aggregated data;</li>
<li><em>Personalization</em>: the estimate of <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{E(S_i)}&#39;\)</span> and the relative coefficients.</li>
</ol>
<p>The techniques used for <em>Tariff Requirement</em> are employed also to estimating the general liability position for the company. This information is particularly important and it is reported in the company financial statement.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> Beyond technical pricing</h2>
<p>In section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:risk-prem-tech-price">1.2.3</a> we defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <em>Risk Premium</em><br />
<span class="math inline">\(P^{(risk)} = E(S)\)</span></li>
<li>the <em>Technical Price</em><br />
<span class="math inline">\(P^{(tech)} = E(S) + E\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>In section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:personalization">1.3</a> we described how the risk premium can be estimated. In this thesis we are not going to deal with the estimate of the expenses.</p>
<p>In this section we are going to discuss what the <em>Tariff</em> and the <em>Offer Price</em> are and which are the further needs that the offer should satisfy. The following description is referred to MTPL insurance in the Italian market. Most of the comments we make can be applied to other motor coverages too.</p>
<div id="tariff-and-offer-price" class="section level3" number="1.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.1</span> Tariff and Offer Price</h3>
<p>The <em>Tariff</em> is the official price for the policy. Over the cost of claims and the expenses, it must include all the loadings for cost of capital and profits. The tariff has a particular importance because it is subjected to strict regulations and it must be approved by the supervisory authority, that in Italy is the IVASS (Istituto per la vigilanza sulle Assicurazioni).</p>
<p>In section <a href="chap-nlip-ita-market.html#chap:pricing-variables">1.3.1</a> we described some of the explanatory variables that can be used to build the technical price. For technical pricing there are no constraints because it is used only for internal monitoring and the final price proposed to the client does not directly depends on it. However, some of the variables used for technical pricing can’t be used in tariff. In particular, the regulations say that companies can’t discriminate clients based on sex, ethnic group, religion or place of birth. Thus, for example, even if from statistical data we see that women usually experience less claims than men, we can’t discriminate men by offering them a higher price. Moreover, some variables have constraints on tariff coefficients. For example, in MTPL insurance, the bonus-malus class is strongly regulated. Every company must recognize the bonus-malus class matured by clients (even if they matured them with other companies) and the coefficients of this variable must be monotonically increasing, i.e. a lower class must correspond to a better tariff. We remind that in the Italian bonus-malus system the lower the class the better the premium. Another tariff constraint is that for some coverage, such as MTPL, the insurer has an obligation to contract. That means that whoever the client is, independently to how risky he is, the company must offer a premium and, if the client accepts, the company must underwrite the insurance contract. In this context, if the company offers an unreasonably high premium, it could fall in an attempt to avoiding the obligation to contract. For this reason, the tariff can’t be arbitrarily high and must contemplate a maximum premium. To be sure that all the costraints has been respected, the tariff, before entering in production, must follow a strict approval process.</p>
<p>To make the offer price more flexible and to facilitate business competition, the supervisory authority allows insurance companies to sell policies not to the tariff price, but to the price obtained subtracting from it a discount <span class="math inline">\(D_i\ge0\)</span>. The premium obtained this way is called <em>Offer Price</em>.
<span class="math display">\[
P^{(\text{offer})}_i = P^{(\text{tariff})}_i - D_i
\]</span></p>
<p>That means that, for the offer price to adequately cover the cost of claims and expenses, the tariff must include a loading for discounting. This loading for discounting, called <em>discounting flexibility</em>, can be partially spended by the agent and partially by the insurance company itself. The discounts can be changed over time in a much more agile way than the tariff. For example in Italy, during the Spring 2020 Covid19 crisis, many companies introduced measures to support clients needs with important discounts on both new business and renewal. From a technical point of view, these discounts have been funded by the remarkable decrese on claim frequency due to the traffic decreasing. Discount measures like these are welcomed by the supervisory authority because they promote business competition and lead to lower prices for consumers.</p>
</div>
<div id="commercial-price" class="section level3" number="1.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2</span> Commercial price</h3>
<p>Both tariff and offer price must be based not only on technical logic, but also on commercial one. They are determined with a process of <em>Price Optimization</em>. The final goal for a company is to maximize profits this year and in the next ones, so the objective of commercial pricing must be obtaining the optimal price to reach this goal. Maximizing profits is a quite generic goal and can’t be easily expressed as an analytical optimization problem. For this reason the pricing choices can be guided by the business strategy that can be translated in specific <em>Key Performance Indicators</em> (KPI) that have to be optimized. In this optimization framework, the technical price can be seen as an estimate of the expected cost related to the policy. Knowing the costs it is possible to tune the final premium by working on margins.</p>
<p>The components that act on price optimization can be addressed to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>technical pricing</em>;</li>
<li><em>client expectation</em>;</li>
<li><em>business strategy</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>We already extensively covered technical pricing in previous chapters.</p>
<p>Client expectation is basically the price that the client is willing to pay for the specific product. Here the basic idea is that if the client would pay a premium much higher than the technical one, it wouldn’t make sense for the company to sell him the product at technical price. This is a big opportunity to gain margins. To analyze client expectation, what is usually done is:</p>
<ul>
<li>for new business modeling his conversion probability</li>
<li>for renewal business modeling his retention probability.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example some guarantees or some options are perceived by the clients as being really worth even if their technical price is not so high. The perception of the client depends also on the competitors pricing and how easy comparing offers from different companies is. In the last years, in the Italian market, the development of aggregators has made much easier for consumers to compare offers from different companies, increasing the competition and the attention on pricing. Anyway, if a company is able to differentiate itself from the others and to make its product been perceived as more valuable, it can sell it at a higher price than other companies. For example this can be achived by improving customer service and customer experience.</p>
<p>If the technical price and the conversion probability function are given, finding the optimal price for a policy can be expressed as an analytical optimization problem. However, to find the optimal price, one should also take into account that usually policies are not sold alone, but in packages of guarantees. With a wider vision, a business strategy could be selling MTPL policy with almost no margins if it allows to sell other guarantees with higher margins. Moreover, as the aim is not to be profitable this year, but also in the following ones, the company should also consider the <em>lifetime value</em> of the client. Indeed, a satisfied client will also stipulate other contracts in the future and can bring to the company other clients from his connections. So, selling a policy with small margins today can lead to high margins tomorrow in other policies.</p>
<p>The business strategy could also contemplate being more aggressive on certain targets of client and less on others. For example, if the company is particularly strong in certain regions, it could make sense for it to push in that region to further increase its market share. Vice versa, in regions where the company doesn’t sell much, it could be safer not to push too much and to be more careful. In a risk management framework, this can be also interpreted as introducing a further risk margin for clusters where there isn’t enough observed data and the lack of information brings to more uncertainty. An aggressive pricing can also make sense for a young company that is growing and it is not supposed to be profitable from the first years. From a marketing point of view this strategy can increase the brand awareness by the clients and can strengthen the company image.</p>
<p>Anyway, a company can’t arbitrarily discount policies because an excess in discounting could cause severe drawbacks on a financial perspective. Therefore, an insurance company must always respect the solvency constraints defined by the supervisory authority to safeguard itself from bankruptcy. The company solvency is essential to protect all the stakeholders, that are both the clients and the investors.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="the-actuary-role" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> The actuary role</h2>
<p>In this technical and commercial pricing framework, the actuary is the one that conduct the analysis and define the pricing rules. The <em>International Actuarial Association</em> (IAA) describes the actuaries are “highly qualified professionals who analyze the financial impact of risk for organizations like insurers, pensions fund managers, and more” and it states that their work “requires a combination of strong analytical skills, business knowledge, and understanding of human behavior.”<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>First of all, the actuary must master the main statistical and data science techniques used to develop model for technical pricing. On this field, in the last years, the development of machine learning and high performance computing has permitted a huge development of technical pricing allowing actuaries to use much more complex variables and models. However, the actuary does not have just to be en expert in statistics and machine learning. He must be also able to interpret the results he gets with his models and use his expertise to understand if the results he gets are fine for future predictions. As we already mentioned, the pricing rules will be used for policies that will be sold in the future, so they have to be defined with a mixture of observation of the past and assumptions on the future. In addition, sometimes it is needed to define price for clusters where the company have no historical data. This can happen when a company is expanding to new customers for example by opening new selling channels or by pushing in regions where its market share is quite small. Furthermore, the lack of historical data can be due to the full sector evolution. For example, in these years, new vehicles, such as electric cars and cars with Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS), are spreading. As these vehicles didn’t exist in the past, historical data doesn’t exist. So, finding the proper pricing is challenging. From the company point of view, positioning with a competitive pricing on these segments is important for future business, but the risk must be properly evaluated. For these kind of tasks, the actuary must have a deep domain knowledge on the field.</p>
<p>In the last years, the increase of competition brought to an increasing in commercial price importance. Now most of the companies build their own conversion and retention probability models and they are developing more complex business strategies. In this context it is fundamental for the actuary to understand the clients behaviors, in order to optimize tariff and offer price. The importance for commercial pricing implicate that the technical pricing must not be conducted independently from commercial pricing. Even in companies where the technical pricing and the commercial pricing are carried out by two separate teams, the two teams have to collaborate and coordinate together. This need have some relevant implications on how technical pricing is conducted that we will further discuss in section <a href="chap-models.html#chap:actuary-importance">2.3</a>.</p>
