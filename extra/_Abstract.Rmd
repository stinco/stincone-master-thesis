This thesis investigates the connection between three well-known human-centric perspectives of linguistic complexity -- perception of complexity, readability, and cognitive processing -- both from a linguistically-motivated and a computational learning standpoint, at various levels of granularity. After a first section highlighting the effectiveness of state-of-the-art neural language models in learning complexity metrics from textual inputs, learned representations produced by those models are analyzed using multiple interpretability techniques stemming from the natural language processing literature. The three perspectives are studied on multiple English corpora spanning three complexity-related tasks: perceived complexity prediction, automatic readability assessment, and gaze metrics prediction. *Add findings*
