- The entirety of this work has been done in partial/total quarantine.

- Davide and Felice for being incredibly supportive despite the distance and circumstances, and who always made me feel part of their labs and their initiatives.

- All the members of the ItaliaNLP Lab in Pisa, who welcomed me in their group for four months and introduced me to the world of scientific research.

- Prof. Elizabeth Schotter, for the amazing introductory course to eye-tracking practices in cognitive science, who greatly helped the development of my intuitions regarding gaze movements during reading and ultimately allowed me to carry out a better and more informed work.

- Fellow students and professors from the DSSC master degree, who consistently provided me with an incredible environment which was both pleasantly familiar and [adj] stimulating. I couldn't have asked for better company during those two years.

- Friends who helped me by reviewing some of the contents of this thesis work. Mattia, who always stood by my side!

- My parents and my family, who are a perfect example of how it is possible to conciliate hard work and kindness, and always supported me in good and bad days, motivating and inspiring me to succeed. I aspire to be like you one day.
